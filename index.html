            My name is Kamil and I would like to share with you my passion for yoga and meditation. 
            Yoga improves flexibility, balance and body strength, reduces stress and improves the ability to concentrate. 
            However, meditation helps with relaxation, reduces stress and improves well-being. 
            On this website you will find a lot of useful information related to improving your physical and mental health.

        <h2>How to start?</h2>
        <p class="second-p">
            Starting a yoga and meditation practice can be a deeply transformative and enriching experience. It is important to begin when you feel ready and motivated to explore these practices.
            The best time to start practicing yoga and meditation is when you are open to embracing the present moment and willing to explore a deeper connection with yourself. 
            Incorporate these practices into your daily routine, finding a time that works best for you, whether it's in the morning to set a positive tone for the day or in the evening to unwind and relax.
            <br><br>
            It is worth remembering that before meditation or yoga becomes your routine, you need time, so don't get discouraged right away, it will take some time.<br><br>
