Testing: 
While testing, it was obvious that there were mistakes, but I managed to quickly understand what I was doing wrong and corrected them. I often made mistakes with the "margin-x" code in CSS and had to enter random values ​​to see what it was for. By the end of making the website, I had everything under control.
